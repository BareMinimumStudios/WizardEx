This mod aims to improve the [Wizarding](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wizards) experience in Minecraft by integrating it with other fine mods such as itself.

Currently, the mod only supports integration with PlayerEx by adding a new "Magic" page that allows the player to allocate their skill points gained by leveling up on the available schools of magic.

The currently available schools are:
- Fire
- Frost
- Arcane
- Healing
- Lightning
- Soul

## How does it work?

Each level in intelligence (base PlayerEx stat) raised improves all magic schools by 0.25 points.

Each level into a specific school of magic will raise it by 0.5, giving you an edge in that school of magic while hampering you in others.

Check out the original mod [here!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wizardex)
